Reporting Security Vulnerabilities (POLARCORE™)

If you believe you’ve found a security vulnerability in POLARCORE™ or any related POLAR™ Healthcare systems, please use one of the following private reporting channels:

Option 1 (preferred): Open a private advisory in our GitHub repository:
https://github.com/polarhealthcare/polarcore/security/advisories/new

This keeps details confidential while we triage and fix.

Option 2: Email the POLAR Security Team at security@polarhealthcare.net
.
If you prefer encryption, request our PGP public key in your initial email and we’ll reply with key details before you share technical findings.

What to include

To help us triage quickly, please provide (as applicable):

A clear description of the issue and potential impact.

Step-by-step reproduction, proof-of-concept, and affected endpoints/modules.

Environment details (version/commit, config, OS/browser, logs if relevant).

Your contact info for coordinated disclosure.

Please do not include any real patient data (PHI) in your report. Redact or synthesize test data.

Coordinated disclosure & timeline

We aim to:

Acknowledge your report within 3 business days.

Triage and provide an initial assessment within 7 business days.

Remediate based on severity (critical issues prioritized) and coordinate a public disclosure once a fix or mitigation is available.
Our default disclosure window is up to 90 days, adjusted as needed to protect users and patients.

We’re happy to credit researchers in release notes unless you request anonymity.

Safe-harbor guidelines

We won’t pursue or support legal action for good-faith security research that:

Stays within the scope of POLARCORE™ and test/demo environments,

Avoids privacy harm, service degradation, or data exfiltration,

Respects rate limits and does not exploit the vulnerability beyond what’s necessary to prove it,

Immediately reports findings and does not publicly disclose before a coordinated fix.

Strictly prohibited: access to production PHI, social engineering of POLAR staff or clients, physical intrusion, DDoS, spam, or any activity violating applicable laws.

Scope (high level)

POLARCORE™ application code and APIs in this repository.

Official demo/staging instances explicitly designated for testing (when available).
Production systems and any third-party services not operated by POLAR are out of scope.

Thank you for helping us keep POLARCORE™—and the patients who rely on it—safely.
